# GetLAPSPassword
A feeble attempt at writing a LAPS dumping tool that supports both NTLM and Kerberos auth using the impacket library.

Initial structure of this tool was taken from the impacket example GetADUsers.py (https://github.com/fortra/impacket/raw/master/examples/GetADUsers.py) and the LDAP queries were taken from https://github.com/n00py/LAPSDumper/.
